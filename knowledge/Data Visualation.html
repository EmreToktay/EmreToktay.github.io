<p>In mathematics, the graph of a function f is the collection of all
ordered pairs (x, f(x)). If the function input x is a scalar, the graph
is a two-dimensional graph, and for a continuous function is a curve. If
the function input x is an ordered pair (x1, x2) of real numbers, the
graph is the collection of all ordered triples (x1, x2, f(x1, x2)), and
for a continuous function is a surface.</p>

<h3 id="univariate">Univariate</h3>
<p>The term is commonly used in statistics to distinguish a distribution
of one variable from a distribution of several variables, although it
can be applied in other ways as well. For example, univariate data are
composed of a single scalar component. In time series analysis, the term
is applied with a whole time series as the object referred to: thus a
univariate time series refers to the set of values over time of a single
quantity.</p>
<h3 id="bivariate">Bivariate</h3>
<p>Bivariate analysis is one of the simplest forms of quantitative
(statistical) analysis.[1] It involves the analysis of two variables
(often denoted as X, Y), for the purpose of determining the empirical
relationship between them.</p>
<h3 id="multivariate">Multivariate</h3>
<p>Multivariate analysis (MVA) is based on the statistical principle of
multivariate statistics, which involves observation and analysis of more
than one statistical outcome variable at a time. In design and analysis,
the technique is used to perform trade studies across multiple
dimensions while taking into account the effects of all variables on the
responses of interest.</p>
<h2 id="ggplot2">3_ ggplot2</h2>
<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>ggplot2 is a plotting system for R, based on the grammar of graphics,
which tries to take the good parts of base and lattice graphics and none
of the bad parts. It takes care of many of the fiddly details that make
plotting a hassle (like drawing legends) as well as providing a powerful
model of graphics that makes it easy to produce complex multi-layered
graphics.</p>

<h3 id="about-1">About</h3>
<p>Histograms and pie are 2 types of graphes used to visualize
frequencies.</p>
<p>Histogram is showing the distribution of these frequencies over
classes, and pie the relative proportion of this frequencies in a 100%
circle.</p>
<h2 id="tree-tree-map">5_ Tree &amp; tree map</h2>
<h3 id="about-2">About</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping">Treemaps</a>
display hierarchical (tree-structured) data as a set of nested
rectangles. Each branch of the tree is given a rectangle, which is then
tiled with smaller rectangles representing sub-branches. A leaf node’s
rectangle has an area proportional to a specified dimension of the data.
Often the leaf nodes are colored to show a separate dimension of the
data.</p>

<h3 id="about-3">About</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot">scatter
plot</a> (also called a scatter graph, scatter chart, scattergram, or

Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for
a set of data.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart">radar

equi-angular spokes, called radii, with each spoke representing one of
the variables. The data length of a spoke is proportional to the
magnitude of the variable for the data point relative to the maximum
magnitude of the variable across all data points. A line is drawn
connecting the data values for each spoke. This gives the plot a
star-like appearance and the origin of one of the popular names for this
plot.</p>

<p>This radar chart displays the preference of 2 clients among 4. Client
c1 favors chicken and bread, and doesn’t like cheese that much.
Nevertheless, client c2 prefers cheese to other 4 products and doesn’t

find the weakness of products which are out of preference.</p>
