 

## About the Challenge:

In the absence of data, I focused on a simplified approach. A couple of nuances to consider based on data constraints include:

If each record signifies a unique purchase, then my calculation for the total purchase revenue should stand correct.
Conversely, if the records indicate purchase types rather than individual transactions, a nuanced approach to calculation is warranted.
## Tool Selection:

I finished this challenge at Python for without platform change for visualization. Although I'm adept at using Google spreadsheet tools, 
I gravitated towards Python due to my comfort level and expertise in it.

# Regarding Power BI:

I may not have deep expertise in Power BI, but my extensive background with Google Data Studio equips me well. 
My holistic experience in data visualization, combined with a deep understanding of data integration and transformation, 
and knowledge of DAX, assures me of my ability to adapt and excel in diverse platforms or tools as necessary.
